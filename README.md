## Features

*   **Full WordPress Hook API compatibility:** Implements the vast majority of WP hook functions.
    
*   **Actions (`do_action`):** Create points in your code where other functions can be executed.
    
*   **Filters (`apply_filters`):** Create points in your code where data can be modified.
    
*   **Priority-based execution:** Control the order in which callbacks are executed.
    
*   **Hook Inspection:** Check if hooks exist, how many times they've run, and what's currently running.
    
*   **Easy to use:** A simple and intuitive API.
    
*   **Zero dependencies:** Lightweight and self-contained.
    

## Installation

You can install package via-

‚úÖ **1. npm install**

This is the **standard** way to install any Node.js package.

```bash
npm install node-hooker
```

Or-


‚úÖ **2. Yarn**

Yes ‚Äî Yarn can install npm packages, because it uses the same npm registry under the hood ( Equivalent to `npm install node-hooker` ):

```bash
yarn add node-hooker
```

---

‚úÖ **3. Test**

After install- you can then run your tests from the terminal simply by using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Quick Start

```js
const hooker = require('node-hooker');

// --- ACTIONS ---
// 1. Register a function for an action hook
function myActionCallback(arg1, arg2) {
    console.log(`Action running! Args: ${arg1}, ${arg2}`);
    console.log(`Currently doing action: ${hooker.current_action()}`);
}
hooker.add_action('app_init', myActionCallback, 10, 2);

// 2. Trigger the action hook
console.log('Doing action...');
hooker.do_action('app_init', 'user_id_123', { setting: 'on' });
console.log(`'app_init' has run ${hooker.did_action('app_init')} time(s).`);


// --- FILTERS ---
// 1. Register a function for a filter hook
function myFilterCallback(text) {
    return text.toUpperCase();
}
hooker.add_filter('format_title', myFilterCallback);

// 2. Trigger the filter hook and use the modified value
let title = 'Hello World';
title = hooker.apply_filters('format_title', title);
console.log(title); // Output: HELLO WORLD
```

## Browser Usage (UMD)

This library can be used directly in the browser. A UMD (Universal Module Definition) bundle is provided in the `dist` folder, which is also available via CDN.

### 1\. Include via CDN

You can add `node-hooker` to your project by including the following script tag. It's recommended to use the minified version for production.

```html
<!-- Regular -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-hooker/dist/node-hooker.umd.min.js"></script>

<!-- Minified -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-hooker/dist/node-hooker.umd.js"></script>
```

### 2\. Example Usage

Once included, the library will be available under the global variable `Hooker`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>node-hooker Browser Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Check the console for output!</h1>

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-hooker/dist/node-hooker.umd.min.js"></script>

    <script>
        // The library is now available on the window.Hooker object
        console.log(Hooker);

        // Add an action
        Hooker.add_action('app_loaded', function() {
            console.log('The application has loaded!');
        });

        // Trigger the action
        Hooker.do_action('app_loaded');
        // Console Output: The application has loaded!

        // Use a filter
        const originalText = "hello browser";
        const filteredText = Hooker.apply_filters('format_text', originalText, (text) => text.toUpperCase());
        
        console.log(filteredText); 
        // Note: Filters require a callback to be added first to have an effect.
        // Let's add one now.
        Hooker.add_filter('format_text', (text) => text.toUpperCase());
        const trulyFilteredText = Hooker.apply_filters('format_text', originalText);
        console.log(trulyFilteredText);
        // Console Output: HELLO BROWSER
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2\. Triggering Hooks

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `do_action(hook, ...args)` | Trigger an action hook (run all attached callbacks). |
| `do_action_ref_array(hook, args_array)` | Same as `do_action()`, but pass arguments as an array. |
| `apply_filters(hook, value, ...args)` | Trigger a filter hook, passing `$value` through each callback. |
| `apply_filters_ref_array(hook, args_array)` | Same as `apply_filters()`, but arguments are passed as an array. |

### 3\. Removing Hooks

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `remove_action(hook, callback, priority)` | Remove a previously added action callback. |
| `remove_filter(hook, callback, priority)` | Remove a previously added filter callback. |
| `remove_all_actions(hook, priority)` | Remove all callbacks for a specific action hook (or priority). |
| `remove_all_filters(hook, priority)` | Remove all callbacks for a specific filter hook (or priority). |

### 4\. Inspecting Hooks

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `has_action(hook, callback = false)` | Check if a function is hooked to an action (or if any callbacks exist). |
| `has_filter(hook, callback = false)` | Check if a function is hooked to a filter (or if any callbacks exist). |
| `did_action(hook)` | Returns how many times an action has run. |
| `current_action()` | Get the name of the currently running action hook. |
| `current_filter()` | Get the name of the currently running filter hook. |
| `doing_action(hook = null)` | Check if a specific action (or any action) is currently running. |
| `doing_filter(hook = null)` | Check if a specific filter (or any filter) is currently running. |

## Advanced Usage: Custom Instances

While the singleton is convenient, you can create isolated instances of the `Hooker` class for separate event buses.

```js
const { Hooker } = require('node-hooker');
const myInstance = new Hooker();

myInstance.add_action('my_hook', () => console.log('Hello from my instance!'));
myInstance.do_action('my_hook');
```
